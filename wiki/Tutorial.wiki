= Simple example =

Two species (electron and proton) with equal temperature and density. The
only non-zero thermodynamic force is the ion temperature gradient.  The  fluxes are evaluated in the banana-plateau regime.  Circular geometry is used.

{{{
>>> nc = [1, 1] # number of ionisation stages per species
>>> zsp = [[-1], [1]] # charge for each ionisation stage
>>> mass = [9.1096e-31, 1.6727e-27] # kg
>>> density = [[5], [5]] # 1e19 m^-3
>>> temperature = [10, 10] # keV
>>> forces = np.zeros((2,1,2))
>>> forces[1,0,1] = 1 # ion temperature gradient
>>> g = dict(rho=0.000165, Rmag=1.65, q=2, bn=2.5)
>>> coeff = neoart.neoart(nc, zsp, mass, temperature, density, forces,
